    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Marsala is a classic Italian American dish that's creamy, quick, and irresistible. The creamy sauce made of mushrooms, marsala wine, and heavy cream is straight-up drinkable, and we love serving it over a big pile of spaghetti or angel hair. The marsala wine makes it slightly sweet and is what gives it that addictive quality. It's the perfect weeknight dinner , and we don't even feel guilty making it three nights in a row. It's a real plus that this dish comes together in a flash</p>
